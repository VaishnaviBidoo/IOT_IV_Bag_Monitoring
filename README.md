<h2>IOT_IV_Bag_Monitoring</h2>

<p><i>The IOT based IV bag monitoring system project is the lack of an efficient system for monitoring and managing IV fluid bags (Saline bags) in hospitals.IV therapy is an essential part of patient care in healthcare facilities, and the safe and efficient delivery of IV fluids is crucial for patient recovery.The current manual system can lead to errors, such as incorrect flow rates, insufficient or excessive fluid delivery, and delays in replacing empty bags. However, managing IV bags can be a challenging task for healthcare staff due to the high volume of patients, the complexity of IV therapy, and the potential for human error.
  
The proposed solution is to develop a smart and efficient monitoring system for IV fluid bags using IOT technology. The system uses sensors to monitor the IV bags and wireless communication to transmit real-time data to a central monitoring station. The system can track
the flow rate, volume of fluid, and time remaining in the IV bag and alert medical staff when the bags need to be replaced. The system can also record data for analysis, which can help healthcare staff make informed decisions about patient care.

The project involves the design and development of a prototype system using microcontrollers,
sensors, and wireless communication. The system is expected to improve patient safety, reduce
healthcare costs, and enhance the efficiency of healthcare delivery. Overall, this project has the
potential to make a significant impact on the quality of care for patients receiving IV therapy</i></p>
